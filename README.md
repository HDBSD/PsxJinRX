# PsxJinRX
Fork of PsxJin with seem quality of life updates

[Download](https://github.com/HDBSD/PsxJinRX/releases/)

# Why

Allthough this emulator is fairly old, a few speedruns require its use. This fork intends to update the experience of the emulator to bring it upto modern standards

# Requirements

Use of input viewer now requires the installation of an additional font - [Link](https://www.fonts4free.net/playstation-buttons-font.html)

This is planned to address this in a later build of the emulator.
