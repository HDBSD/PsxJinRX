# PsxJinRX
Fork of PsxJin with seem quality of life updates

# Requirements

Use of input viewer now requires the installation of an additional font - [Link]: https://www.fonts4free.net/playstation-buttons-font.html
I plan to address this in a later build of the emulator.

# Improvements

This fork of PsxJin only implements quality of life improvements, none of the underlying core is modified. A list of changes can be found below;
